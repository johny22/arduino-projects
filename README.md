Here are my mini-projects made with the Arduino. In an attempt to acquire some skill with embedded systems.

### Simon Game ###

Attempt to reproduce the **Simon Game**, which is available [here](http://www.freesimon.org/).
In my version, for simplify I used two LEDs to signal whether a sequence is right or wrong..
 + Right: Yellow and Green
 + Wrong: Yellow and Red

The circuit design is available for [simulation](https://123d.circuits.io/circuits/2308514-simon_game/embed#breadboard). But I recommend taking it only as a model, because the simulation left to be desired in comparison with the end result.
